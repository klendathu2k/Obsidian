[ ] Highlights last week

Discussion of volume IDs with Daniel... specifically how to integrate over the three subvolumes that make up the sTGC sensitive volume (pentagonal shape) in the sTGC planes.

Discussed also how the material budget code works.  By default it is volume centric.  Could be extended to score material by volume instead.  

Email discussion with Jinlong (and added Gene) on doing full field and reversed full field simulations.  Chain options looking reasonable for 2015, but needed to add in distortions.  Jinlong concerned about event timing ... but timing looks reasonable.  O(10s)/event for simulation stage.  O(100s)/event for digitization+reco.

Akio is noticing a library error thrown when simulating pythia events and applying a filter.  Debugged...  Due to the introduction of the fast jet dependency. 

SHREK... 

Jobs DID NOT RUN OVER THE LONG WEEKEND!!!   Yet another issue with PanDA.   Paul has possibly resolved the stage in/out issue.  But TBD.  Looks like Tadashi needs to tweek something, and he must have been out the door.

shrek... are jobs running through? Nope.
