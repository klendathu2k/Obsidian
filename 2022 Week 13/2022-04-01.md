SHREK
- Run test ala...
```
pchain --cwl shrek/shrek.cwl --yaml shrek/tests/hfpass1.yaml --outDS user.jwebb2.d86f313f-6658-483a-98e6-6e9bc260ef02 --vo wlcg --workingGroup sphenix --prodSourceLabel test
```
- The shrek.cwl is supposed to create two files
	- 'runjob.sh' and 'g4charm-env.sh'
	- First file is a simple wrapper which sets up the parameters which must be passed in as command line options, and calls the second script
	- The second script initializes the environment, sets up environment variables which control execution of the user commands, and then runs the user commands specified in the yaml file
- Neither of these files are showing up in the directory where we run
- Few possibilitie
