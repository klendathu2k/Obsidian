# 2022 Week 11  Summary
geant4star
- Discussed [[geant4star status]] @ S&C Meeting / EVAL released COB Friday
- Integration plan... asked for review on open PRS
- Draft PR for the geant4maker ... requested code review

StEvent
- I have been asked to assume responsability for maintenence
- Discussed @ S&C on Wednesday.  Jerome noted that this is our event data model and, as such, is required to function independent of other packages in STAR.
- Discussed offline w/ Jerome on Thursday... recommended that I talk with Thomas about the responsablities here.  Also noted that there will always be pressure when someone integrates a new maker / model / etc... to add dependencies...
- Also the ongoing saga (losing / lost battle) about the trigger data
- Should have a long(er) term goal of updating documentation... 
	- [We can convert exisiting LaTeX documentation to markdown](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/341899/latex-to-markdown-converter)
- And providing unit testing...
	- StEvent should load with minimal (fixed) dependencies... simple load macro which does not rely on BFC to sort the dependencies...

sPHENIX production system
- Continuing to struggle with PanDA issues... something about Puppet overwriting Chris's configurations... so test jobs being submitted to try to help sort his all out
- Have been diving into both the sPHENIX simulation production chain and trying to express this in terms of a PanDA workflow... (but constrained with PanDA issues as well)...
- Few things I have concluded... Expressing even simple workflows in the Common Workflow Language is going to be a pain in the butt
	- Testing this behind a PanDA submission is only going to make things worse, b/c access to log files through digging through web pages from a failed job b/c one small part of the workflow is ill specified... No.  Just no.
	- Plan is to wrap each part of the sPHENIX workflow in a CWL file, so that each part of the workflow can be tested *at the command line with full access to the CWL output, generated log files, error messages, etc...*
	- Then when it comes time to feed the PanDA, each piece of the workflow has been testted, and the only thing that needs to be debugged is the overall steering workflow.  (Which can be tested outside of prun... pchain as well)

- Complicating this... the pchain examples all have "prun" as the executable node in the CWL graph... 
	- So... 
	- I guess that 


Daily Notes / Weekly Summary
- Needed to make a change because linear [google document]() is becoming unwieldy for keeping track of everything.  Decided to keep daily notes, as well as detailed notes and smaller notes, using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  
- Obsidian is a free, markdown-based note taking system.
	- Paywall for syncing to a server, but... easy to sync to [github](https://github.com/klendathu2k/Obsidian/tree/master) under a cron job...
	- Sync to github allows easy way to share with others... (albeit somewhat limited b/c intra-note links will not be available... but direct links will).
	- Can organize notes into directories... which I should have started with...
	- So now, my daily notes can be linked into more detail notes as I work on them, and I can navigate between... also, can visualize how notes interconnect...

	- Now for the real test... cut-and-paste into my google doc...
	
Need to attend to Pull Request [PR287](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/287) sTGC offline today.

Need to release EVAL on afs

Need to setup laptop with *correct* ssh key... (not clear why that didn't happen yesterday morning)

Need to cleanup notes... reorganize into folders... because... this will get cluttered, and I will be right back where I started...
