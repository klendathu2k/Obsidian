# 2022 Week 11  Summary
geant4star
- Discussed status @ S&C Meeting / EVAL released COB Friday
- Integration plan... asked for review on open PRS
- Draft PR for the geant4maker ... requested code review

StEvent
- Have been asked to assume responsability for maintentence of the STAR Event Data Model.  
	- This should not consume a significant amount of time, but requires careful review of proposed changes that touch StEvent.
	- Quick discussion w/ Jerome on the subject... mainly on the "sociology" aspects... developers (read physcists) do not normally understand the requirement that StEvent cannot have dependencies on other packages (eg makers)... so there will need to be some explanation at each point...
	- So medium term (as time permits) plan to (a) update the StEvent documentation... (currently a LaTeX document, not updated in decades...) and (b) setup unit testing of StEvent.
- [ ] Pull Request [PR287](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/287) sTGC offline
	- Need to revisit this one again... COB Friday
- [ ] sPHENIX Prod MC Submission (target date week 12)
	- [x] Better understanding of the sPHENIX pileup workflow
	- [ ] Trying to match up CWL description with what they are trying to do
		- [ ] Also trying to get files back... the PanDA is stingy
	- [ ] Given that the PanDA doesn't want to run... focus on wrapping each stage of the sPHENIX workflow in a CWL script... then, when the time comes, a single CWL document should be able to chain it all together with pchain.
- [ ] geant4star EVAL deployment (target wednesday...)
	- [x] Check code status
	- [x] Quick AOB for Wednesday's meeting
	- [ ] Needs AFS release...
- [x] Setup obsidian <--> github sync
	- Setup as a cron job executing every 15 minutes to backup the notes.  Github repository is set as public / browsable
	- [  ] Setup Obsidian on my laptop...
- [ ] Review email filters... (S&C shoudld *not* be autosaved to a folder)
- [x] Update ssh key on laptop... but wtf?
