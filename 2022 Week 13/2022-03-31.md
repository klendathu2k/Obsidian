- More fun with Obsidian notes...
	- Setup crontab to create weekly notes directory and copy a template every week day at 1 AM.

- Wlodek asking about z-vertex distributions for simulations of 2017 pp data...
	- They are not seeing reasonable looking distributions from the MuDst (I presume this is b/c they are not selecting on minbias triggers?)

- sPHENIX production...
	- Mentally stalled at the moment... so...
	- Whatever instability was in the pchain submission yesterday seems to have resolved.  So...
	- Move from the test rig /cwl-runner on local to a full on batch submission test...
	- Getting the following error now

	```
	 prun: error: unrecognized arguments: $(inputs.extra_panda_args)
	```
	- There seems to be an issue in CWL with using an input paramter w/in the command definition for prun...
	- Code is now running on condor... [job page](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/11237/)
	- Looking at the prun command issued... I note that the environment variables defined in the shell script are not being evaluated at the stage of executing prun.  This makes sense... they are created when the shell that prun executes... executes.  (That sentence got away from me...)
		- prun is the chicken.  the shell script  created by CWL is the egg...
