- StEvent Maintenence
	- Able to convert the (ulta-legacy) LaTeX documentation into markdown, suitable for becoming the README.md in the StRoot/StEvent/ directory... this will make the document available / browsable on github.  
		- images (.eps files) do not show, but otherwise readable / understandable
	- Used the "pandoc" application on my home linux system
	- We can convert any (all) .tex documents sitting in the doc/ areas in the repo
	- Will need to fix my repository's main branch (got sloppy and committed something directly to it...)
	- The StEvent documentation is woefully out of date... predates Barrel and Endcap calorimeters (circa 2003 then)
- sPHENIX Workflows / Production System
	- By dumping log files straight to disk (/sphenix/users/sphnxpro/out.txt) was able to start testing the pass 1 production macros.
	- Needed to reshape scripts / macros slightly... b/c we need to encapsulate the complete job into a single script, passing in the software release level
	- Verified that jobs run, they obtain independent random seeds (sequence number), and produce output.
	- Copying back (for now) direct to disk.  Will sort out rucio access after we can run through the pass 2 workflow (pileup against pre)
