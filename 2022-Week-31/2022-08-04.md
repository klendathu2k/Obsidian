sP22m 10 HF charm 50 minb background, stalls at pileup b/c pileup job cannot resolve the secondary dataset for some reason.

ROOT files size looks reasonable.  TAR file size looks reasonable.  Jobs do not appear to have crashed.  

It appears that PanDA is launching the pileup task before the dependency is resolved?
