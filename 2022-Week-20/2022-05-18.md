Yesterday's run...
[successful](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/66719/)
[unsuccessful](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/66722/)

... and I don't see the difference.  So perhaps I need to run with maxAttempt > 1

It may be that the third job is starting before the requirements are satisfied?  May be an issue on the server side?  (Again?  Really?)

#!!@# ^&  IT WAS SERVER SIDE.  Things are running now.
