Okay.  Setup a test using the simple 2:1 test workflow.

top1 has 3 jobs, with wildcard used to specify the output file
top2 has 3 jobs, with wildcard used to specify the output file

bottom brings in data sets... using wildcards.

Without the wildcards, I know how this is supposed to behave.  There will be three jobs in the bottom part of the workflow.

Wait a tick... no, I don't *know* that.  I *assume* that.  Looking at the result file from the previous tests... bottom may be recieving all of the inputs in a single "dataset..."
