Switching things up to an actor model... when a dataset matches, forward the name of the DS to a script.  And let the script do the shrek submission... (and documentation? and etc...)...

Basically start to loosely couple things.  shrek (submit) to become (only) a high level interface to PanDA / pchain.   donkey (watch) checks for dataset in rucio and dispatches to user defined scripts, which can call other services... (e.g. shrek to dispatch to PanDA).  

But first have to make the damn thing work... and right now, sh.Command does not seem to be executed...

... okay, something seems to be swallowing the output.  Por que?

... can capture stdout, stderr and forward to functions... this works.  And is a useful feature.

```
donkey --submit  --match '*sP22s*CharmSimu*.tar' --period=3600 --startdate='2022-08-03' --actor submitToPanda --prescale 5

Time for a proper test submission...
