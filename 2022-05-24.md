Latest from Tadashi / Paul... PanDA / rucio is not configured correctly to stage-in of files.  Stage-out, yes... it gets the path correct.  But stage-in, no.

Dumb question... *why* didn't this get caught by a unit test?  Has PanDA been tested at BNL, or am I the guinea pig here?

... should not have started on email from home this morning... comute is getting pushed back.  Akio wants to get together to talk about StEvent / StMcEvent / StHit / idTruth / DC / many tracks : one cluster...

Refresh my memory here...

StEvent/StHit has had idTruth and QAtruth in the event model for ~19 years.  It is the dominant contributor model for hits - track association.  TPC centric,
potentially useful for other detectors.

Calorimeters (large acceptance towers) can accumulate more tracks... may want to / need to disentangle the MC truth information.

StMcEvent/StMcHit is a c++ class generalizing the g2t hit table entries.

StMcEvent/StMcCalorimeterHit is a c++ class (does not inherit from StMcHit) that associates track : tower : dE.  It does not accumulate hits, so multiple StMcHits per tower.

To perform energy / track association studies... several options, each of which require analysis code to be implemented...

---

StMcEvent/doc does not compile due to (1) latex is not available, and (2) missing a sty file (when I try to compile locally).  I can convert to markdown using pandoc... should do this for our doc directories...

---

I don't see any example macros...

---

StAssociationMaker may be the analysis code we are looking for here...
... nope.  This is TPC only.  But gives the gist of how to do this.

---

Discussed w/ Akio (and Kolja, who was here for another question...) about how to proceed.  Plan is to

1) Implement dominant contributor model to StEvent/StFcsHit and propagate to the MuDst.  
	- Requires no changes to EDM b/c StHit implements DC IDtruth.
	- This should be short time scale (easier for him to code than to create a PR in git...)
2) Implement the many : one mapping between track ID w/ dE and tower ID. This requires extension of StFcsHit and downstream MuDst codes.
