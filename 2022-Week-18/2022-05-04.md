- Shrek Update

- Problem with submitting the sPHENIX workflow could be related to how the output data set is defined in the CWL.  For some reason,... it is not pass2/outDS but just pass2?
	- YAML files need to be adjusted so that the output data sets have the proper naming convention for PanDA...
	- This is really a TODO list item... we should be automating the naming of the data sets behind the scenes... users can name them what they want, but internally they should be represented for PanDA.
	- The input data set for the second stage was also ill defined.
	- ODDBALL.... pythia8charm has no optargs defined.
		- b/c I failed to specify any output files!  **This is an untrapped failure mode.**


TODO:
- Jinlong has cycled back... still having embedding issues.  Follow up on this.
- Still owe Diptanil time... shift to this later today.
