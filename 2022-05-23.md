Hrmm... cron job seems to be down and this week's directory with it?  

SHREK--

Well, my error report to Tadashi did't carry much weight, because I didn't clearly see the directory path.  The log file does not demonstrate the problem.  However, the fact remains that 'tar' is unable to unpack the file.  And also, the use of forceStaged implies that the file should end up in the working directory, not be presented as a link.  So.  Something is broken.
(Perhaps my reading of the documentation.  Perhaps another mistake in the workflow.  But probably something in the PanDA/Rucio installation.)  So...

1) Provided additional detail / context to Tadashi.
2) Setup another test, this time using unix `readlink -f` to follow and report the actual file.  Maybe that is sufficient and I can unpack direct.

--> no joy.  still get an error from tar when trying to unpack.

Email from Tadashi, asking Paul why the files are landing where they are... so perhaps the issue is about to be resoved?...
