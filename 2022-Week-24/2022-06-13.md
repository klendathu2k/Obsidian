[Massive PR](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/366)
- logic was inverted in the FGT cluster maker for rejecting nullptr hits
- libquadmath is being linked on the FORtran side...
	- would be useful to know what the warning this solves is b/c changing precision has bit us hard before.
	- minor error, so should be good.
	- Few additional commits coming in as we go... 

- SHREK... run latest test... and still broke.  Tadashi had found something pilot related (I think) on Friday... I guess Paul has not had a chance ot look at this...

- Distributed computing... asked Tadashi / Paul for an update... 

- Okay... some refactoring to implement the git / documentation layer for production...
	- Implement a configuration file for shrek  (Site, vo, etc...) on configuration branch.
	- Max number of submissions --> config parameter
	- Now need to implement the scheme.
		- tag --> submission directory
		- branches for
			- development (default) : dev
			- test submission (dry run) : test
			- submission : production
