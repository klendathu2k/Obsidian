- AgML extensions (but using the TGeoExtension mechanism)
- PR #311 will change the mechanism associating the extensions with the volumes (lookup table / map vs framework)

- StGeant4Maker
- Touches many areas

.... crap.  I had made a mistake on my repo and committed something on the main branch.  Need to sort that out today...

Looks like I am three commits ahead...

I think reset head@3 will resolve the issue...

Did not work.  $#!@ git.

So...

git reset --hard upstream/main

Expectation is that the *main branch* on my local will be brought current (or at least consistent) with the main branch upstream.

All of my local branches seem to be intact.  I do not trust git.  So I will clone my repo before pushing...

And now... doing

`git diff main upstream/main`

shows that my local main branch is same as star-bnl/star-sw.   This is expected.

`git diff main origin/main`

This *is not expected!*  Suggests I am throwing away 75 commits!  And numerous differences are shown?  Dafuq?  Duplicate commits?


BAH.  It's just three commits, and I believe they were committed / pushed on a seperate branch regardless...


[[geant4star status]] report prepared for S&C around March 16th 2022.  ... doesn't look like it was given at the 3/16 meeting.
