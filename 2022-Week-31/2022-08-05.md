----- 

Charm & Minb @ 100 events is already failing a wallclock check...  Looks like there is a 2h limit on the job's walltime?  But why?  Regardless,...

Add maxWalltime @ 48h (but documentation?)

Should have an answer around noonish.

Distortion corrections will potentially require a looping workflow... or at least a check on convergence before proceeding automatically?  Or possibly this introduces a bottleneck where many files need to be input into the distortion correction job.  Should try to get a handle on this ~soon.

IF I were doing this myself... the distortion correction would be handled by a loop w/in the task...  there is really no need to involve PanDA here (bash can implement for loops... so can python...)  And it is not a complicated workflow... it is just take the results of the track finding pass, iterate on it, provide calibrations to the next track finding pass...

The only thing (I think) is that there should be some error checking done.
