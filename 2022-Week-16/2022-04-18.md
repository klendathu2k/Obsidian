Brain is not sufficiently caffeinated this morning.  But.  Recalling where I left off last week, ... ready to start implementing the tools to create the submission package.

Central to this is the 'YamlHandler'... which will take the dictionary read in from the yaml input file, and create the submission scripts, workflows, etc...

....

As I am going through this, I am starting to realize that I should create a set of classes to read the data into.
