sP22m 10 HF charm 50 minb background, stalls at pileup b/c pileup job cannot resolve the secondary dataset for some reason.

ROOT files size looks reasonable.  TAR file size looks reasonable.  Jobs do not appear to have crashed.  

It appears that PanDA is launching the pileup task before the dependency is resolved?

Minbias jobs:
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=132106&mode=drop&display_limit=100

Last job was created at 21:48 .. took 1m45s to start ... ran for 10m  Should have ended around 22:00...

Pileup jobs:
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/132116/

These were created at 22:16... so the secondary DS should have been available by that point.

Metadata (pruned...) for the minbias DS...

It exists, is not hidden, ... but also not closed?  Not flagged as complete?
