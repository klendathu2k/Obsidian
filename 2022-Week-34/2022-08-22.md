- [ ] [Update Telework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16AZZBiKL1s6eGgH2KFiJPnD8-TjRsC0HYy4Qdmbr358/edit#gid=0)

- More thinking on memory layout for geometries...
	- During track propagation through a volume, calculation of the next safe step size will be the most frequent operation
	- Step limits will be calculated due to 
		- Physics process (requiring material / medium lookup)
		- Intersection with daughter volumes (requiring shape lookup and reference system transformation)
		- Exiting of the current volume (shape lookup)
		- Limitation due to bending of magnetic field (...)
	- Data locality would suggest keeping the parameters of the daughter volume close together.
		- new TGeo* and new G4* allocates on the heap with no guarentees of proximity in memory...
		- Likewise, users likely to have odd memory access paterns... such as reusing materials from widley distant (in memory) volumes, reusing rotation / translaotion matrices, reusing shapes, etc....
		- So there are no guarentees of users creating code which is cache friendly

- Basic idea is to create a library which regularizes the memory layout for geometry models...  

parent volume : material | medium | matrix 1 .. matrix N | shape 1 .. shape N | daughter 1 .. daughter N 

One does not need to get too fancy here...  

struct VolumeBank {
    Volume volume;
	Material material;
	Medium medium;
	int numberOfChildren;
	std::vector< Matrix > matrix;
	std::vector< VolumeBank > children;
}


-----------------------

More discussion regarding the sTGC material budgets... they are "seeing" inconsistencies comparing mother volume to sum of daughters... which makes little sense...

Got pointer to the code and will review when I have a chance

Waiting on jobs to fail for sPHENIX to report...
