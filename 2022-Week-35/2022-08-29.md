[Charm signal @ 200 events](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=133264&mode=drop&display_limit=100)

Seems to have finished... but the finish task failed?

rucio list-files user.jwebb2:user.jwebb2.sP22s-hfcharm-signal-test10_000_Pythia8CharmSimulation_Pythia8CharmSimulation.outDS.tar

Files look okay... 200 tar files produced with reasonable size. (?)

... 

But the background events did not go through due to walltime issue?  There I tried to scale up to 1k events... probably premature.  So let's run with 200 events and be done with it.  Then we can extrapolate to a larger sample.
