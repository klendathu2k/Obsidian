Quick test... confirm that updating a dataset results in submission.  It does.

So...

donkey is working as expected.  It can poll rucio to discover new datasets matching a given pattern.  (The pattern match on the dataset name is by the rucio rules... it may be better to do a broad capture of dataset names and then apply a regex locally... but I suspect that will introduce inefficiencies / slam the rucio server as the datasets become large...)


Well... donkey picks it up...  b/c I have echo in the actor script, not actually submitting.
