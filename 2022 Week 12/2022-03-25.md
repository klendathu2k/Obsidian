- Problems that I was having with the "hello panda" top / bottom pchain example were probably b/c the --site specification was incorrect.  Need to move it into the prun command w/in the CWL file?
	- Job ran... at least one part of the workflow seemed to succeed
	- top.txt was written
	- bottom workflow failed b/c of reasons... why?
