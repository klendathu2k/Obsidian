---------

SHREK
- Two options for a demonstration:
	- Define pass1 + pass3calo + pass3trk using SHREK
	- Use SHREK to run the existing HF workflow (including the hand crafted file management they coupled into the Fun4All macros)
	
	
bfcMixer_jet crash:

- Segfaults running against SL16d_embed
- Does not fault under DEV, but also doesn't seem to run any events?
- Runs from event 390 to the end... so if not enough events in fzd or daq file?  Try from iEvent=0.

- [x] Fix mismatch in root versions.   Does not resolve problem.
- [x] WHAT THE HELL?
	- [x] StChain:INFO  - Construct module KludGeo
	- [x] Fails safe w/ ntube = 0
