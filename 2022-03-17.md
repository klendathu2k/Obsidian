ssh key issue from laptop...
Jupyter notebook access to STAR account works (but seem to not be able to write to afs?)

Jupyter notebook failed to start sPHENIX account. ....  shift to github pull requests. ... use the default environment instead.

- geant4star
	- [ ] Release EVAL??? Something is up.  Cannot write to the afs device...
		- [ ] Probably something to do with my login... having trouble with (new) ssh key on laptop... so am logged in through Jupyter this morning.
		- [ ] TBD

sPHENIX prod system
- [ ] Disk space for output?
- [ ] Jupyter login

Okay.  CWL is a dog's breakfast of a language, with little useful in the way of documentation beyond examples of how to do fairly simplistic things.   It is widely used in bioinformatice contexts, but that complicates things b/c any examples I see out in the wild have a somewhat foreign context to parse through.  So...



I am having problems combining workflow submission with 

I would like to be able to configure a production by editing the top level CWL or YAML file.... this likely requires the entire sPHENIX environment to be spooled up in the CWL execution environment.  

Significant wrestling with the CWL syntax... and PanDA.  A few thoughts:
1) PanDA job submission (*prun*) is rather lightweight and nice.  It will automagically propagate source files (I think) from the cwd to the remote, and then run your command.
2) PanDA workflow submission (*pchain*) relies on the common-workflow-language (CWL) which is a *pain in the assembler* to learn.
3) Debugging *either* is going to be problematic, but *pchain* will be next to impossible, unless we think through how the workflow is built up.  Specifically, with PanDA I really don't know where to go to get log files and start to debug... and reading the CWL output ... it provides hints at where things go wrong, but the documentation is a real dog's breakfast.
4) CWL allows workflows to be *nested*.  And **IF** my assumption about pchain is right (it should also stage input files) **then** we should be able to wrap each stage of the sPHENIX processing in a CWL file.
