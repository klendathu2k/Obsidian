# 2022 Week 11  Summary
geant4star
- Discussed status @ S&C Meeting / EVAL released COB Friday
- Integration plan... asked for review on open PRS
- Draft PR for the geant4maker ... requested code review

StEvent
- I have been asked to assume responsability for maintenence
- Discussed @ S&C on Wednesday.  Jerome noted that this is our event data model and, as such, is required to function independent of other packages in STAR.
- Discussed offline w/ Jerome on Thursday... recommended that I talk with Thomas about the responsablities here.  Also noted that there will always be pressure when someone integrates a new maker / model / etc... to add dependencies...
- Also the ongoing saga (losing / lost battle) about the trigger data
- Should have a long(er) term goal of updating documentation... 
	- [We can convert exisiting LaTeX documentation to markdown](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/341899/latex-to-markdown-converter)
- And providing unit testing...
	- StEvent should load with minimal (fixed) dependencies... simple load macro which does not rely on BFC to sort the dependencies...

sPHENIX production system
- Continuing to struggle with PanDA issues... something about Puppet overwriting Chris's configurations... so test jobs being submitted to try to help sort his all out
- Have been diving into both the sPHENIX simulation production chain and trying to express this in terms of a PanDA workflow... (but constrained with PanDA issues as well)...
- Few things I have concluded... Expressing even simple workflows in the Common Workflow Language is going to be a pain in the butt
	- Testing this behind a PanDA submission is only going to make things worse, b/c access to log files through digging through web pages from a failed job b/c one small part of the workflow is ill specified... No.  Just no.
	- Plan is to wrap each part of the sPHENIX workflow in a CWL file, so that each part of the workflow can be tested *at the command line with full access to the CWL output, generated log files, error messages, etc...*
	- Then when it comes time to feed the PanDA, each piece of the workflow has been testted, and the only thing that needs to be debugged is the overall steering workflow.  (Which can be tested outside of prun... pchain as well)
	

	
	Need to attend to Pull Request [PR287](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/287) sTGC offline today.
	
	] Pull Request [PR287](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/287) sTGC offline
	- Need to revisit this one again... COB Friday
- [ ] sPHENIX Prod MC Submission (target date week 12)
	- [x] Better understanding of the sPHENIX pileup workflow
	- [ ] Trying to match up CWL description with what they are trying to do
		- [ ] Also trying to get files back... the PanDA is stingy
	- [ ] Given that the PanDA doesn't want to run... focus on wrapping each stage of the sPHENIX workflow in a CWL script... then, when the time comes, a single CWL document should be able to chain it all together with pchain.
- [ ] geant4star EVAL deployment (target wednesday...)
	- [x] Check code status
	- [x] Quick AOB for Wednesday's meeting
	- [ ] Needs AFS release...
- [x] Setup obsidian <--> github sync
	- Setup as a cron job executing every 15 minutes to backup the notes.  Github repository is set as public / browsable
	- [  ] Setup Obsidian on my laptop...
- [ ] Review email filters... (S&C shoudld *not* be autosaved to a folder)
- [x] Update ssh key on laptop... but wtf?
