Need to be able to script runs... e.g. define a command line parameter and have it picked up by the job specifications.

Basic idea here is to establis

```
--command=value
```

Gets exported as environment variables in the scripts as

```
$shrek_command = value
```

Easily implemented.  Now any `Parameter` block can refer to a variable defined on the command line.  e.g.

`shrek-submit ... NCharmEvents=1000 NMinBEvents=100`

and the script will have `$NCharmEvents` and `NMinBEvents` avaliable.

Test job w/ merge step added...

The idea motivating this feature is that after a dataset is produced, we can execute the "merge" shell to utilize rucio to close the input dataset, and produce a summary output log as the output set.
