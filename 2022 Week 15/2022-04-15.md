Issues yesterday with the schema... were... annoying.  Most likely something along the lines of whitespace and/or typo that I just couldn't spot.  SImply implementing the schema piece by piece seems to have resolved the issue.
(Maybe something as dumb as inserting a \\t ???)

Now have support for multiple primary and secondary input data sets....
