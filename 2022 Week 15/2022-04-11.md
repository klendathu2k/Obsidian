-----------------------------------------

### TODO
- [ ] Follow up on SL16d_embed rebuild
	- [ ] TOF/BTOF simulation will be important... archeology

-----------------------------------------

- Jinlong Simulation Issue
	- SL16d was recently removed, motivating a move to SL16d_embed... which the prod team had not updated at the time of the bug fix (was not necessary as it had not been recompiled w/ new compiler... but once it was... boom.)
	- Need to catch up on the thread, and make sure that we have closed the loop on starsim rebuild b/c it impacts physics results... (requires root4star rebuild as welll.. b/c statically linked).
	- TOF/BTOF 

- SHREK
	- Strongly leaning towards system where the workflow is reflected in the directory layout ... drawing heavy insparation from System V Unix initialization...
		- Each directory maps onto a workflow
		- Each directory contains a YAML file providing the parameters of the workflow (and responsible for mapping the user job onto the workflow)
		- Each directory may contain other directories, resulting in steps creating the nested workflow
		- Conditional steps and looping constructs are declared within the YAML files defining the job parameters...
		- At no point does a user need to touch / create a CWL file... it is automatically created by SHREK
		- Python code to convert yaml file to executable script is easy and more flexible than what I was doing with cwl.
		- The CWL conversion from the directory structure... 
			- was originally going to brute force this, but... after a break from thinking about this... better to grab the directory structure as an ordered dictionary, and then traverse...
			- build nested workflow from the dictionary...
				- Bleh..... does the dictionary preserve the order of files vs directories... this... no, this does not matter b/c we are require only one yaml file per directory... If there is a step to merge outputs... it is done as a workflow following the previous steps...
