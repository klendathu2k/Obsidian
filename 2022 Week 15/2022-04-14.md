Likely to need an in-memory representation of the graph of job descriptions we are building.  It would also be nice to have some level of error checking during the build process, so we can quickly identify and debug errors in the workflow.  So ideally we would want to have a python based graph library.

https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonGraphLibraries

[python-graph](https://github.com/Shoobx/python-graph)
- Stable, reasonably active, have to build code using make? documentation lacking?  (built with make?)

[networkx](https://networkx.org/)
- Stable, reasonably active, extensive documentation in easy reach...

[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/)
- ... 

Basically narrows down to the last two... will do a quick evaluation.  The API looks a little bit simlper / easier w/ networkx.  6 vs 1/2 dozen.  Go with networkx (pip install-able).
... and, it is already installed (may be used under the hood by PanDA or some other previously installed tool).

Next need to settle on another implementation detail.

To describe the workflow graph, we have several options...

- Organize code into directories, using the names of the directories to denote the direction of the graph...

```
+ 001_SIMULATION/params.yaml
+ 002_PILEUP/params.yaml
+ 003_RECONSTRUCTION/params.yaml
|
+--+ 001_CALORIMETER/params.yaml
+--+ 001_TRACKING/params.yaml
|  |
|  +--+ 001_CALIBRATION/params.yaml
|  +--+ 002_TRACK_FINDING/params.yaml
|  +--+ 003_TRACK_FITTING/params.yaml
|
+ 004_MERGE/params.yaml                   
```

- Organize code into directories, with parameters holding same names as directories...

```
+ 001_SIMULATION.yaml
+ 001_SIMULATION/
+ 002_PILEUP.yaml
+ 002_PILEUP/
+ 003_RECONSTRUCTION.yaml
+ 003_RECONSTRUCTION/
|
+--+ 001_CALORIMETER.yaml
+--+ 001_CALORIMETER/
+--+ 001_TRACKING.yaml
+--+ 001_TRACKING/
|  |
|  +--+ 001_CALIBRATION.yaml
|  +--+ 001_CALIBRATION/
|  +--+ 002_TRACK_FINDING.yaml
|  +--+ 002_TRACK_FINDING/
|  +--+ 003_TRACK_FITTING.yaml
|  +--+ 003_TRACK_FITTING/
|
+ 004_MERGE.yaml                   
+ 004_MERGE/
```

Laying the code out into directories like this has the advantage that users can quickly see the structure... but one could also flatten the design...

```
100_SIMULATION.yaml
100_SIMULATION/
200_PILEUP.yaml
200_PILEUP/
300_RECONSTRUCTION.yaml
300_RECONSTRUCTION/
310_CALORIMETER.yaml
310_CALORIMETER/
310_TRACKING.yaml
310_TRACKING/

311_CALIBRATION.yaml
311_CALIBRATION/
312_TRACK_FINDING.yaml
312_TRACK_FINDING/
313_TRACK_FITTING.yaml
313_TRACK_FITTING/

400_MERGE.yaml                   
400_MERGE/
```
