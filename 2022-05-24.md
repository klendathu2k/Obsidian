Latest from Tadashi / Paul... PanDA / rucio is not configured correctly to stage-in of files.  Stage-out, yes... it gets the path correct.  But stage-in, no.

... should not have started on email from home this morning... comute is getting pushed back.  Akio wants to get together to talk about StEvent / StMcEvent / StHit / idTruth / DC / many tracks : one cluster...

Refresh my memory here...

StEvent/StHit has had idTruth and QAtruth in the definition
