[[ROOT6 Status]] 
[[GEANT4STAR Integration]]


geant4star building [PR377](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/377)... had to make some modifications to the build script.


 Need to bring geant4star and ROOT6 back onto the front burner
 - ROOT6 
	 - Plan to make this a focused S&C effort
	 - Need involvement from Infrastructure, Production and Simulation ...
	 - Need to establish a "production release" compiled against ROOT6 and begin running nightly builds / nightly tests
	 - Find what fails and fix
	 - Without failed tests... unclear what Victor's changes address...
- GEANT4STAR
	- Stalled out... partially b/c no organic interest from the forward group (or at least no time for effort)
	- Should move first PR today
	- Xin will try to stir up some interest in validation efforts / tuning physics lists / etc...
