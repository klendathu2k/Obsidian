Copy the schema for shrek from yesterdays [[2022-04-12]] notes to the [[SHREK]] document.

Would prefer to have a schema definition tool to validate yaml files against.
[Some options](https://json-schema-everywhere.github.io/yaml) to research.

	- Jinlong reports the AgNEED issue is still present after starsim recompiled under cvmfs
	- Confirmed that code appears to be correctly compiled
	- Asked Jinlong to confirm that he is running in CVMFS and (if so) to run a test against DEV.
	- Strongly suspect he is not running against CVMFS deployed lib.
