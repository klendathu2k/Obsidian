[PR398](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/398)
- Several minor issues, two major ones
	- Direct access to member variables defined on StFwdTrack
	- StFwdTrack introduces an external dependence (genfit) onto StEvent


Where are we on shrek?

Donkey can be setup / used to monitor rucio for new datasets, and automatically launch workflows when a new dataset is closed.

Shrek can build workflows from the YAML inputs, and can parameterize input dataset names so that donkey can launch workflows through shrek.  Further, user can pass in arbitrary configuration information.

We are not (yet) able to run at the 48h mark.  Still having trouble at 2h?  Unclear why.
