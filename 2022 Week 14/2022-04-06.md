- sPHENIX Production System
	- Time to settle on some design decisions
	- Each step in a production worfklow should be described by a single source
	- The description should be complete b/c it has to be able to run the job
	- The description should be compact b/c a human being must maintain / implement it / minimize PBCK errors 

- StEvent maintence 
	- Will discuss w/ Thomas this afternoon


- StArray assert in Embeddinng...
	- Good news... caused in StEmcMixerMaker.... (can therefore speed things up by dropping track reconstruction completely...)
	- Assert occurs when an EMC collection is added to StEvent
		- The collection fails the following
	
	```
	(gdb) p val->TestBit(TObject::kNotDeleted)                           $6 = false   
	```
 
	- Error in the neighborhood that StMcEvent is not found...
	- This is the only (first) event where StMcEvent was not found...
		- So we are likely falling into something of a corner case
