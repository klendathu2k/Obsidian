Wow.  Wednesday already.  

SHREK / sPHENIX workflows...

Looking at running sPHENIX workflow for HF plus pileup, running the minbias simulation samplle in situ.

Pythia8 minbias appears to run using input HepMC files  located here: /sphenix/sim/sim01/sphnxpro/MDC1/pythia8_HepMC/data/ 

Each file has 10k events.

Would like to split that up a bit.  1k events / job.  10 jobs per input file.

Cannot currently use Rucio as part of job submission...



STAR / S&C Meeting
- eTOF 
	- near term goal run 20 FXT datasets... eTOF performance sub standard.  
		- Bug Iin code / latest calibartion not loaded
		- FIx PR made / merged
		- Repass Mu to Pico?  Matching issue?    
			- In principle, yes... this is a fix.  Need proper chain options / macro...
	- moar issues
		- on the fly calibration / fixed
		- shift due to changes to calibration / fixed
		- alignment needs to be made
			- applied
		- geometry is updated / PR is made...
			- But I heard... alignment tables...
			- Inquire about simulation geometry misalignments...
				- Nope.  They should not require these... anything on the TPC side (calibrations, alignments, etc...) end up rolled into uncertainties in the eTOF alignments... which of course need to be accounted for
