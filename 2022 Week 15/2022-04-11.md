### TODO
- [ ] Follow up on SL16d_embed rebuild

-----------------------------------------

- Jinlong Simulation Issue
	- SL16d was recently removed, motivating a move to SL16d_embed... which the prod team had not updated at the time of the bug fix (was not necessary as it had not been recompiled w/ new compiler... but once it was... boom.)
	- Need to catch up on the thread, and make sure that we have closed the loop on starsim rebuild b/c it impacts physics results... (requires root4star rebuild as welll.. b/c statically linked).

- SHREK
	- Strongly leaning towards system where the workflow is reflected in the directory layout ... drawing heavy insparation from System V Unix initialization...
		- Each directory maps onto a workflow
		- Each directory contains a YAML file providing the parameters of the workflow (and responsible for mapping the user job onto the workflow)
		- Each directory may contain other directories, resulting in steps creating the nested workflow
		- Conditional steps and looping constructs are declared within the YAML files defining the job parameters...
		- At no point does a user need to touch / create a CWL file... it is automatically created by SHREK
