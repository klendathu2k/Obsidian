- pp 2015 Embedding Issue...
	- Jinlong will test

-  sPHENIX Production System / SHREK
	- Forgot how useful it is to stand in front of a whiteboard, talk and draw things.  Few things I realized yesterday...
	- Timing matters.  So we should prefer to transform sources at the start of the submission, archive, and then let PanDA transfer the production scripts, rather than generate in place on the worker node.
	- Jobs are probably going to be long running.  May be fed in over time (as data comes in from the experiment).... and individual steps in the workflow may be ready to run before others... Need to plan for that.
		- Workflows can be conditional... so can define the logic there.
	- Worth diagramming this out again, putting source codes by the workflow boxes... and then think about how they are to be archived via git... / layed out in directory structure...
		- Directory structure should reflect the structure of the workflow?
		- Had a completely irrelevant convesation with Jeff Landgraf about linux startup scripts... which actually seems relevant now.  Can order the execution of objects sitting in a directory by their name... e.g. 	something like...
			001Generate.cwl
			002Pileup.cwl
			003Calorimeter.cwl
			003TpcReco/001Pass1.cwl
			003/TpcReco002Pass2.cwl
			004PhysicsObjects.cwl 
			etc...
			
	- Should consider using python github API for a top level interface... [pygithub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)
