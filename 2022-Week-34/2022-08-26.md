- Rucio is also sick...

STAR Material Budgets

Almost certainly an issue with the code which steps through the geometries... I think we are off by one node... getting the material in the previous tracking step, rather than the current one.  (This would not be apparent when looking at top-level plots of detectors, but when drilling down into subassemblies...)

First, commit the code that handles the filter in both locations where it needs to be handled... 

Second, try modifying to use the endnode to obtain material.  This seems to fail on a couple of fronts.... 

Still seeing material show up in the STMP histogram... (wait... really?  )
