- Jobs finished... but...  okay... output files sizes look reasonable at each stage....     but...
- StageA crashed... error on run number... input filename is probably incorrect... TBD.

Filename used by Chris has the runnumber as the last element in the filename...

... and probably botching the downstream filenames as well ...

TODO: Need to have GlobalParameters, which defines global parameters which can be locally overridden in any parameter block...

STAR 

--------------------------

Yuri has a PR in for updating hits with local curvature... relevant to low pT tracks... FIrst order the code looks reasonable.   Improved information is saved.  However, unless there is a separate PR somewhere, we have dead code writing to this field.
