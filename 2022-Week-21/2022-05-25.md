Akio / Daniel StEventTypes.h vs including FCS headers...
- cons always prefers StEventTypes.h from the repository
	- question is why... may be b/c we don't want analyzers to have the abiltity to corrupt the event data model.  
	- may be because cons is not sophisticated enough to follow nested includes.

SHREK...

Paul recommended a change / Tadashi implemented / but ...

jobs still fail due to missing inputs...

DC meeting today, posed the question about when this might be resolved.  ~day doesn't seem to be in play... but maybe day or two...?  (No firm commitmemnt, though.)

So... shift to other tasks.

Made the point that I'd rather not be doing the unit testing here...  hopefully did not come off poorly.

S&C Meeting today...

YF presented new dEdx (plus rah rah rah TFG release is the best! rah rah!)  Made the comment that our PR review process is a bit broken... but perhaps his expectation of 1-2 days when touching / creating 173 should be revisited.

Come to think of it... I would wager that the time to review is a nonlinear function of the number of files / lines of code changed.... would be an interesting metric to look at...
