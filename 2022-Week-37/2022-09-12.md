------------------------

STAR Collaboration meeting this week.  

Monday -- Junior's Day

Probably not worth sitting in on many talks, but will zoom connect into Rongrong's and Daniel's presentations @ 1030 AM.   Theory talk from a (new-ish) NMSU prof... too bad it's not Mattias. 



Tuesday -- Parallel Sessions

Some interesting looking cold QCD talks... 

Wednesday -- Parallel Sessions

Hard probes WG... Talk on a pythia model... May be worth catching.

Thursday -- Plenary Sessions...
