500 signal jobs + 2k BG jobs (reusable) 
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?jeditaskid=132498|132497|132499|132518|132496

Ran to completion.  Output files for each of the reconstruction jobs look to be reasonable in size.  Can we scale further?

Try doubling up on the input list... (does PanDA check for duplication here
... no.  PanDA does not allow dataset duplication here (it drops the duplicate definitions.)

Okay.  Moving on.  Let's setup the new workflow that Chris informed me about.

First, tag the MDC2 directory @ shrek-mdc2.8

Next, update remote.  Pull.  And branch from main shrek-ana.315.



### STAR

Pythia8 update... again, Dmitri is pushing to separate out the interface from the external packages.  Yes, in an ideal world it is the correct thing to do.  No, it is not worth the effort here.   At least not for the moment.
