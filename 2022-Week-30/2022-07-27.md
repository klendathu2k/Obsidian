----------------------------------------------

sPHENIX workflow is running at the scale of 10 HF events @ 10 jobs.  Plan is to scale (eventually) to 1k events / job.  

To reduce the number of minbias events we need to run... should allow the reuse of files in the secondary stream... 

```  
--reusableSecondary REUSABLESECONDARY
A comma-separated list of secondary streams which reuse files when all files are used
```

First crack at adding this... not getting the resuable flag propagated?

NOTE:
Should consider refactoring...

`--workDir WORKDIR     All files under WORKDIR will be transfered to WNs (default=./)`

... maybe pchain sends files to remote server, and from remote server, back?

----------------------------------------------

Go rucio working by executing the setup script on cvmfs, and copying the sphnxpro config file.  This probably piggy backs off of an sphnxpro account at rucio.  

----------------------------------------------

Akio has submitted [PR379](https://github.com/star-bnl/star-sw/pull/379) adding ID truth information (track ID, sum dE) for each FCS hit.

Looks like myself and Daniel (aka James) Brandenburg are assigned as reviewers.  (Me for StEvent ownership, DB for MuDST ownership).  Should probably get one external (to the forward group) reviewer here...  

```
$ rucio list-rses
BNL_PROD
MOCK

$ rucio list-scopes
mdc2
panda
garvin
user
user.tmaeno
user.jwebb2
user.kkauder
```

Nice... looks like I already have something in the system...

```
$ rucio list-dids user.jwebb2:*

... wow... everything that I have generated...

$ rucio list-dids --filter type=DATASET user.jwebb2:*
$ rucio list-dids --filter type=CONTAINER user.jwebb2:*

$ rucio list-files user.jwebb2.sP22a-hfcharm-fcc6d415-f22a-11ec-b9e0-00163e101048_001_Pythia8MinbSimulation.log

```

So... looks like (many / most / all) of the datasets which have been generated by the PanDA are stored / cataloged by rucio.

```
$ rucio download user.jwebb2.sP22a-hfcharm-fcc6d415-f22a-11ec-b9e0-00163e101048_001_Pythia8MinbSimulation.log
```

This seems to have failed.

```
Can use wildcards with the "tag"...

$ rucio list-dids user.jwebb2:*sP22a-hfcharm*

Or the hash which is appended to the tag...
$ rucio list-dids user.jwebb2:*1163993b-0db3-11ed-8d50-00163e10104*
```
