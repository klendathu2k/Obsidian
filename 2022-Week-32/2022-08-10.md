### sPHENIX
-------------------


Running pileup on larger sample...
1) The nJobs field is not respected... should be using nFiles instead... (and nFiles does limit the number of jobs launched...)
2) I expect the full sample to have issues b/c of mismatch b/twn signal and background files...

Chris P. has new set of macros... 

Setup reusable secondaries...  first order appears to be working.

Can we scale this to the full charm dataset?  It would appear so...

Okay... now what about adding in branching logic?

Conditional workflow--

"when" clause...



### STAR
----------------------

Rongrong wants to run pythia8 pAu...

Need to add Au to particle DB... actually, may need to switch from TDatabasePDG to StarParticleData...  That seems to have done the trick...  Looks like pythia8 is taking some time to run a HI fitting model.

... but running AuAu... reachs an assert statement.
... assert is on the event record ...  so currently limited to p A collisions...
... assert can be released, but then issue with AgSTAR reader ...

run 100 events with pAu... success... commit the code...
