Need to be able to script runs... e.g. define a command line parameter and have it picked up by the job specifications.

Basic idea here is to establis

```
--command=value
```

Gets exported as environment variables in the scripts as

```
$shrek_command = value
```

Easily implemented.  Now any `Parameter` block can refer to a variable defined on the command line.  e.g.

`shrek-submit ... NCharmEvents=1000 NMinBEvents=100`

and the script will have `$NCharmEvents` and `NMinBEvents` avaliable.

...

Added "mege" as a parameter, which then takes as an arguement the command to execute on merging a job... running a test (but it seems to be taking too long to show up on the monitor... TBD.)
