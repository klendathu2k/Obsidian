Okay.  Setup a test using the simple 2:1 test workflow.

top1 has 3 jobs, with wildcard used to specify the output file
top2 has 3 jobs, with wildcard used to specify the output file

bottom brings in data sets... using wildcards.

Without the wildcards, I know how this is supposed to behave.  There will be three jobs in the bottom part of the workflow.

Wait a tick... no, I don't *know* that.  I *assume* that.  Looking at the result file from the previous tests... bottom may be recieving all of the inputs in a single "dataset..."

Okay.  Once again my assumptions about how things *should* work (based on SUMS) run up against how they actually work under panda.  Looks like I need to do a [scatter](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/pchain.html#sub-workflow-and-parallel-execution-with-scatter) operation.  

And then... 

1) Documentation by example (pchain) is not sufficient
2) Even the simple (linear) workflow does not behave the way I expect.  The second job takes the whole data set (not each file in the dataset) as input.
