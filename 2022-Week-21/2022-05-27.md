SHREK...

The PanDA is still upset at me... or maybe she's upset at the Condor, and just not passing any work to him.  Regardless, looks like i am stalled on this.  Sent an email to Tadashi / Paul about this, but...

Here is an operational issue.  I submitted jobs 18h ago, and nothing is going through.  I am not the only user who is experiencing this.  From a production standpoint...  who is responsible for catching these issues?  Seems like infrastructure / facility should be on top of keeping the PanDA happy.
