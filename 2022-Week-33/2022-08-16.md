sPHENIX workflows...

[Reworked with latest sPHENIX macros](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?jeditaskid=132728|132733|132713|132726|132735|132758|132725)

- calorimeter jobs crashed / runnumber
- pass3 crashed due to run number...

okay... it looks like someone reworked the way the run number is read from the files...

... all the way back to the pileup job ...  dafuq?

Actually... this may be important:
```
DST_background listfile background.list does not contain filenames if this is the only list you load into this Input Manager your code will exit very soon
```

The background files did not extract?

- [ ] TODO: Go back and check the *successful* 500 job scaling test... did tht pileup jobs actually succeed?
