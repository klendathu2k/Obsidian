I have an issue with jobs submitted through PanDA not being able to run longer than 2 hours.  I am generating simulated events (no input files).  

200 events / job  (https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=133037&mode=nodrop&display_limit=100)

Keeps going and going until a task executes in under 2h.

[200 events / job signal w/ maxWalltime 48h](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/133005/)

Explicitly claims that wall clock issue, but all jobs fail at the 2h point...
