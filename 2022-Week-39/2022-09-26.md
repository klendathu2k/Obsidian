- [ ] [Update Telework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16AZZBiKL1s6eGgH2KFiJPnD8-TjRsC0HYy4Qdmbr358/edit#gid=0)

---------------------

Jobs failed due to wallclock issue.  WTF?

[Pilot jobs](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=134934&mode=drop&display_limit=100) executed in 1d7h.  So should be under the 2d limit.

First job in the queue...

I woul claim this executed in under 24h... Friday 1:49PM start time... 1:11PM finish time.  But ....

Minimum wall time was 27h or so... (100k/3600...)
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/134934/#plots

So... 
1) Jobs are still being terminated early
2) There is a significant discrepancy between how much time the simulation task takes to execute, and the time that the PanDA monitoring states is consumed (or I am misreading plots and other diagnostics...)
