[Charm signal @ 200 events](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=133264&mode=drop&display_limit=100)

Seems to have finished... but the finish task failed?

rucio list-files user.jwebb2:user.jwebb2.sP22s-hfcharm-signal-test10_000_Pythia8CharmSimulation_Pythia8CharmSimulation.outDS.tar

Files look okay... 200 tar files produced with reasonable size. (?)

Maximum of 30ks per job.  So 8h20m for 200 events.  Or 41h for 1k events.  So IF I submit now... 1PM on Monday... should have 1k events ~ AM Wednesday...  And should have many such jobs rolling off the production.
So setup as test 11.

... 

But the background events did not go through due to walltime issue?  There I tried to scale up to 1k events... probably premature.  So let's run with 200 events and be done with it.  Then we can extrapolate to a larger sample.
