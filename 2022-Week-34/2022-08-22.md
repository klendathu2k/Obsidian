- More thinking on memory layout for geometries...
	- During track propagation through a volume, calculation of the next safe step size will be the most frequent operation
	- Step limits will be calculated due to 
		- Physics process (requiring material / medium lookup)
		- Intersection with daughter volumes (requiring shape lookup and reference system transformation)
		- Exiting of the current volume (shape lookup)
		- Limitation due to bending of magnetic field (...)
	- Data locality would suggest keeping the parameters of the daughter volume close together.
		- new TGeo* and new G4* allocates on the heap with no guarentees of proximity in memory...
		- Likewise, users likely to have odd memory access paterns... such as reusing materials from widley distant (in memory) volumes, reusing rotation / translaotion matrices, reusing shapes, etc....
		- So there are no guarentees of users creating code which is cache friendly

- Basic idea is to create
