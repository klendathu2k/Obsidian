### sPHENIX
-------------------


Running pileup on larger sample...
1) The nJobs field is not respected... should be using nFiles instead... (and nFiles does limit the number of jobs launched...)
2) I expect the full sample to have issues b/c of mismatch b/twn signal and background files...

Chris P. has new set of macros... 

### STAR
----------------------

Rongrong wants to run pythia8 pAu...

Need to add Au to particle DB... actually, may need to switch from TDatabasePDG to StarParticleData...  That seems to have done the trick...  Looks like pythia8 is taking some time to run a HI fitting model.

... but running AuAu... reachs an assert statement.
