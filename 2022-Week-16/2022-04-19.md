Jobs are nodes.  Edges connect jobs from output to input.

WorkflowGraph class is setup... need a script to drive it... need to setup something more complicated in the way of a workflow than sim+pileup.

Slow start... not building up the edges...  

Okay.  We can parse in a very simple workflow... a simulation job (with no input) followed by a pileup pass on the output of the simulation job.  The following figure is pretty annoying, but shows the directed graph is pointing in the right direction.

Much more complicated workflow graph.  Looks good.

So I think the skeleton is in place... we can build up the graph of jobs connecting the inputs and outputs to form the pipeline... Now I need to be able to create the workflow documents from the graph.

First... I may have not accounted for how secondary datasets are utilized in the PanDA / pchain.  Appears that the workflow grapg may / can depend on them as well.... 

Dumb question being does PanDA support multiple input data sets... I think no.

--> SHREK may have to establish a different convention here.  b/c there needs to be a distinction between input data sets produced by jobs in the pipeline, and pre-existing data sets that do not extend the pipeline.  TBD.

Have key... moving day... will probably take two or three passes at this.  Books and computer on first pass...  Keep in coding groove until lunch...
