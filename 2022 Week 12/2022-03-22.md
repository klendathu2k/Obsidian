- sPHENIX production system
	- No output on latest run...  wtf?
	- Run shell locally... okay...
	- Run single job on PanDA... wtf.
	- Run hello panda workflow... works
	- Remove .root files from submission area... resubmit full workflow execept skip the simulation.... 
	- Now enable simulation...  If this succeeds, then either (a) we were out of quota and could not write back the file, or (b) problem submitting job b/c of the unstaged root file...
