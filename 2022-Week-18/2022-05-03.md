SHREK

TODO: PanDA authentication... when we run shrek-submit, if the token needs to be refreshed, the process will hang at that point.  We need instead to send a hello world to the panda  server, and make sure we have that token first...

- Few more iterations... seems to be issues on the server side now.  But simple chain runs the top and bottom workflows...
- But the bottom workflow is still failing...
- May be on my end... looks like the bash script is flaky...

Job ran to completion.  YAY!  So Shrek can create workflows that run through the PanDA.  

... a few notes... script generation is somewhat fragile.  Need to think about how documentation lines get exported.  

Quick test w/ the more complicated workflow... not surprisingly fails b/c datasets are unknown.
