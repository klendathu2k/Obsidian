- Added schema check on test yaml files for the more-complicated-example.
- Schema is now enforced when building the workflow document
- Panda / pchain should validate the CWL... (it doesn't at the moment...) but this should be part of the test suite...
	- Annoyingly, pchain is just a script... no execute_pchain option in the API.  Fine, just shell it out.
