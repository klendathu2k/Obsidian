- [ ] [Announce NPPS Distributed Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8DAzhCwpVoRM_WptpZFKqJev4-odk4xDl5rDK6JMYs/edit#heading=h.d6jxgv7ina59)

I suspect that `sh` is the best option for this... subprocess replacement... maps programs onto function calls...

```
$ pip install sh
$ python
>>> import sh
>>> sh.git.status()
On branch github-integration
Changes not staged for commit:
...
```

Added build artefacts to version control.  But... throws error on subsquent submissions.

Need to have github credentials cached... TODO... ensure that they be cached...

Code is being pushed now... tags are not...

Have to push the tag name...

Now setup run to produce the pileup sample...

... but...

Looking at the 2:1 simple workflow... inputs to the bottom task are failing.  Por que?  Por que?

Pilot error?  (Call the NTSB...) "File size cannot be zero: output file has size zero: user.jwebb2.121408._000001.results.root')]:failed to transfer files using copytools=['mv']

...

This may be output error, not input error as PanDA monitor suggests...
