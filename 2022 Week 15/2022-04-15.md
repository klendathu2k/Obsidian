Issues yesterday with the schema... were... annoying.  Most likely something along the lines of whitespace and/or typo that I just couldn't spot.  SImply implementing the schema piece by piece seems to have resolved the issue.
(Maybe something as dumb as inserting a \\t ???)

Now have support for multiple primary and secondary input data sets....

Add a Local Initialization adn Finaalization code block to the job definition schema, allowing users to (for instance) do a git checkout / clone / what have you before launching a job...

Maybe need a requirements block as well?

Regardless, it is time to start populating the job submission area...
