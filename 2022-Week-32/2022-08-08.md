- [ ] [Update Telework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16AZZBiKL1s6eGgH2KFiJPnD8-TjRsC0HYy4Qdmbr358/edit#gid=0)


Friday's jobs died... again due to the wall time limit of 2h, but desipite that I flagged it to extend said limit to 48h + ... Apparently there is something else going on?

Launch smaller jobs w/ the goal of running pileup based on input datasets that have been pregenerated...
