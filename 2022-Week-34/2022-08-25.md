STAR Forward

Fairly certain that material budget issue is due to air being counted in the volume... (it's a surprisingly large contribution...)  So mdify the agml checker to allow one to ignore air...

Added code to ignore Air contribution in material plots... made PR... Nicole does not confirm it works.

- There is a second section of code where the filter needs to be applied
- There appears to be a mismatch ... I think that we are filling the material histograms wrong.... one step off.  Or rather one node off.  (Material should come from the end node, not the start node,  of the step?)
