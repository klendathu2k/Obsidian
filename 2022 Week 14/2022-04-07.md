- JInlong's Embedding Issue...
	- Issue found yesterday has to do with the simulation stage... FZD file contains completely empty events.  St_geant_Maker does not see an EOF so continues to read in.  EMC simulator maker holds a stale pointer to an EMC collection, which then tries to be added to StEvent and kaboom.
	- Problem is with the simulation. 
	- simLamFilt.kumac is the simulation file...  I don't see any issues
	- I am at the level of guessing what went wrong.  I suspect that a very corrupt vertex position was used as input to the simulation...
