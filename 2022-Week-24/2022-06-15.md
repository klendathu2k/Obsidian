- Held distributed sw meeting
- No STAR S&C meeting today
- SHREK ...
	- Add shrek inputs, workflow graph, general documentation to the github archive...
	- Interesting feature idea would be to created a linked... markdown version of the CWL file... trace back inputs to the shrek sources...
	- Now try to debug the HF workflow...
		- Looking at the hacked output directories... the minbias jobs never produce a logfile that gets copied... so perhaps the input issue is accurate...  
		- If memory serves... the minbias events required input files... how are those provided?
