Tadashi replied... apparently "walltime" means something different than I would expect.  Namely, there is a x2 safety margin applied.  If pilot jobs don't finish w/in 50% of the stated wall clock lmit, the jobs will not proceed.  (*This is not sane*).

`rucio ls ...`

I would have expected some files ... e.g.
`user.jwebb2:user.jwebb2.sP22a-hfcharm-dd935966-0db1-11ed-8bc0-00163e101049_003_Pythia8Pass3Track.log`
... to be no more, since I erased them.  Looking at the metadata... the dataset is "expired"... but not deleted.  ???
