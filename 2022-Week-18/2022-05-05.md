SHREK / sPHENIX workflows

Looking at the Fun4All macros... I get the sense that there are some serious issues with the sPHENIX code regarding stable production environments.  These macros seem to be assembled by cut-and-paste to implement different facets of the production chain.  Simulation, tracking, calorimetry, etc...  There are opportunities for cut-and-paste errors which could lead to differences between geometry models in different parts of the workflow.  Possibly other issues as well.  It will be something to keep an eye on.
