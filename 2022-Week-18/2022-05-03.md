SHREK

TODO: PanDA authentication... when we run shrek-submit, if the token needs to be refreshed, the process will hang at that point.  We need instead to send a hello world to the panda  server, and make sure we have that token first...

- Few more iterations... seems to be issues on the server side now.  But simple chain runs the top and bottom workflows...
- But the bottom workflow is still failing...
- May be on my end... looks like the bash script is flaky...

Quick test w/ the more complicated workflow... not surprisingly fails b/c datasets are unknown.
