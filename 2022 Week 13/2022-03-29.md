sPHENIX Production System...
- Issue yesterday was that I was specifying an incorrect prodSourceLabel... "test" is allowed.  "test_jcw"... not so much.  This is more than just a "label", as it impacts which work ques jobs are assigned to...
- Can the --nJobs be parameterized?  It is set as an opt_ arguement in the workflow examples, but the CWL language suggests that is just somewhat arbitrary...
	- Unclear...  It doesn't look like I can add a parameter
- Think I realize that there are two ways to run multiple jobs.  One of which is to scatter across an input dataset.  The other is to specify nJobs.
- ... so ...  bleh.
