Hi All,

I have an issue with jobs submitted through PanDA not being able to run longer than 2 hours.  I am generating simulated events (no input files).  

200 events / job  for 10 jobs
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/jobs/?jeditaskid=133037&mode=nodrop&display_limit=100

Several jobs succeed, with run times under 2 hours.  But... some do not run within that time frame, and PanDA will keep re-running those jobs until it either gets one through, or reaches a limit and fails the workflow.

If I adjust some of the command line parameters (maxWalltime) I still run into the same problem... 

[200 events / job signal w/ maxWalltime 48h](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/133005/)

Question is whether this is an issue with PanDA imposing a 2 hour time limit, or is Condor imposing the limit.  And how to release the restriction.
