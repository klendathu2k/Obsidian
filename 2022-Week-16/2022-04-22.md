Continuing to implement a set of yaml files from which  [more complicated workflow](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/pchain.html#more-complicated-chain) example can be created.

Few things that I have concluded in this process.

- PanDA makes an arbitrary distinction between "input data sets" and "secondary data sets".  I don't see any reason to make this distinction. 
	- Workflow dependencies have to be created between jobs regardless of whether the dataseit is "input" or "secondary..."
	- Options (nFIlesPerJob, etc...)  are available whether it is input or secondary
	- Files are mapped onto %IN, %IN2, ... %INm tokens ... in that order, from "input" to "secondary"...
