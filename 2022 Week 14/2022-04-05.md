	- Tadashi does not seem interested in adding the CWL InitialWorkDir entries into the tarball sent to the condor.... 
		- Naively I am assuming that PanDA is executing the CWL file with a CWL-runner on the remote server. 
		-  If so, then the shell scripts created by the CWL InitialWorkDir requirement would be available and could be added to the tarball without much effort on his part.
		-  Could there be security concerns?  (Same concerns/solutuions for uploading the user code tarball I would imagine)
		-  OTOH, if PanDA is handling the workflow itself (i.e. if PanDA is a CWL runner) then it may be more effort to implement this than he has time for.
	- Either way... pays off to think about other options for achieving the same goal...
		- When in doubt... templates
		- Natural solution here.  The workflows themselves will be fixed, so we only need to update wtih changes to parameters (such as input data sets, user scripts to run, etc...)
