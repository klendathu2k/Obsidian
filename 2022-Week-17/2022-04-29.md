------------------------------------------------------------

Highlights

- SHREK has reached a milestone.  Able to define and *validate using pchain --check* two PanDA examples:
	- [Simple task chain](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/pchain.html#simple-task-chain)
	- [More complicated chain](https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/pchain.html#more-complicated-chain)
- Few tweaks to the generation step, and should be ready for a quick submission test to PanDA...
- "Quick" never seems to be correct when talking about PanDA submission.  
	- The pchain jobs seem to hang in the "submitting" category...
