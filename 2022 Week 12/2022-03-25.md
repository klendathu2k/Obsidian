- Problems that I was having with the "hello panda" top / bottom pchain example were probably b/c the --site specification was incorrect.  Need to move it into the prun command w/in the CWL file?
	- Job ran... at least one part of the workflow seemed to succeed
	- [PanDA Workflow Progress](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/idds/wfprogress/)
	- top.txt was written
	- bottom workflow failed b/c of reasons... why?
	- top part of the chain [11031](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/11031/)
	- I would expect ID 11032 to be the bottom part, given that they are sequential, the jobs are trivially fast, and the workflow monitor says I was running tasks 11031 and 11032.
	- Taskflow monitor shows that the bottom task 11032 was broken... misspecified?
	- I cannot access at [11032](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/11032/)
	
The site needs to be specified ... presumably as part of the prun command w/in the CWL file.

Doing that... and resubmitting the job...
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/idds/wfprogress/

It doesn't show up in the workflow monitor.  Joy.  And I don't see anything reported out to the log files...

This would be *the big advantage* to running CWL workflow *locally* -- I get to see / capture the task ID, and launch monitoring processes.

Looking at my user page [here](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?display_limit=300&username=Jason%20Webb) shows 11031 and 11032 are the last two request IDs processed.  So I see no evidence that PanDA is accepting any new jobs from me via pchain...  Try prun.

~~Gave me a task ID [11048](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/task/11048/)~~

It may have been 11045...
