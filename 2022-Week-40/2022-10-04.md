WTF?  Simple workflow is only executing the top part of the chain?  

`$ rucio ls user.jwebb2:*simple*03-Oct*`
`$ rucio ls user.jwebb2:*simple*04-Oct*`

Both submissions show only the top portion executed.  (Plus the log files written only show for the top...)

Try the 2-->1 workflow.

[simple 2-->1](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?taskname=user.jwebb2.simple-chain-2to1-04-Oct-22-test1_*) ... also failed... 

Top level wfprogress page shows failure, but diving into it shows success... *but* it is only success for the first job in the workflow... dependent jobs are not processing through.

... and this is consistent with what I saw on the hf production chain.  The "finish" tasks are failing to start...

Bug report time.
