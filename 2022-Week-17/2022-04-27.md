Presented / discussed [[SHREK Status 04-27-2022]] at sPHENIX distributed meeting...

Discussion on whether I have dug down into the details required for PanDA submission... (it is not obvious from what I have been presenting...)

Eseentially... fairly easy to define an abstraction layer... but if you want to define an concrete implementation underneath that abstraction, you should know sufficient details in order to implement that...

This is why I spent time testing... emailing Tadashi back and forth... etc...  to get to the scheme that will satisfy the initial design goals of single source job definitions... (don't want to split between the CWL file, YAML input file, and shell script...)

---

BLARGH!  PanDA cannot handle a semi-colon in the current working directory's path!  Or a '$'.  (Yes, I am using some non standard characters here... there is a reason... user should really pause to think before deleting, renaming, moving, etc.. and making it difficult is a bonus...)

---

Simple chain now validates against the PanDA...
