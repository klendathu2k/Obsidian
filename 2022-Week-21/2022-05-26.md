## Thursday {{date}}

On Tuesday, Kolja was looking for a "hello world" example for PanDa... b/c he was having some troubles.   SHREK  did not work for him out of the box b/c there are alot of unresoved dependencies...  so googled for a new trick:

[How to list project dependencies in python](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42237072/list-dependencies-in-python)

After yesterday's meeting, and given lack of email today... looks like it may be a while before PanDA actually works at BNL.  Beyond being able to run single stage (in --> job --> out) type jobs.  But need to make progress on setting up the sPHENIX workflow...

So...

More debate on StEvent... Akio really wants to add an extra int (primary track parent id) which will have zero additional physics content.   My innate obstinance may be an asset here.
