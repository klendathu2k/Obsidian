I suspect that `sh` is the best option for this... subprocess replacement... maps programs onto function calls...

```
$ pip install sh
$ python
>>> import sh
>>> sh.git.status()
On branch github-integration
Changes not staged for commit:

```

Added build artefacts to version control.  But... throws error on subsquent submissions.

Need to have github credentials cached... TODO... ensure that they be cached...

Code is being pushed now... tags are not...
