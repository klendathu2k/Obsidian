Single job ran overnight...  good.  Scale up to 500.

Examining log files... I think I forgot to append the ".root" suffix to the output files.  Meh.  Scale production test...

Also... fix the .root, add in serial number, and resubmit a small scale (10 file) test...

Okay.  500 jobs seem to run fine.  And the updates with the correct filenames etc... are working as well.

Scaling to 500 jobs works well... 

------------

Kolja forwarded a question from Makoto Asai about running GEANT3... my reply was to have a look at the VMC project as a starting point... has the most recent version(s) of the geant3 sources.

Am wondering if it would be feasible / possible / advisible to modify the cmake files to compile only the FORtran codes...  with no dependency on VMC stuff... for really legacy applications.

Ah... the context here would matter.... hard pass (outside work scope / ...)

----------------

Now let's run a deeper test job.  Simulation of 10 1k event charm jobs.  Just charm.  First, let's start with looking at the successful 500 job run..

15 events generated ... approx 1k seconds / job.  So with a 2h (7200 s) time limit... could scale this up to ~100 events... with a few jobs failing.  Will want any failures to be clear... so set maxAttempt at 1.

cpuTimePerEvent may have been too short as well.  120k HS06s (whatever that is) for 10 events... means 1.2M should be set.  (Just to be safe make that 2M)
