Highlights Week 13

Implemented the following prototype using plain vanilla `cwl-runner`... no pchain submission:

Have the following proof-of-concept:
```
$ cwl-runner shrek.cwl run_hfcharm_pass1.yaml
```

The `shrek.cwl` file takes as input a user-specied job configuration file (`.yaml` file) which specifies all of the job's properties...

``` 
$ cat run_hfcharm_pass1.yaml

# Specifies a unique name for the job                                  
jobname: g4charm

  # e.g. root.exe -q -b Fun4All.C

copyback: |-                                                                                                                             
  ls > ${g4charm_RUNNUM}_${g4charm_SEQNUM}.manifest     

```

The `stagecmd`, `commands` and `copyback` blocks are merged into shell script, which is generated by the cwl runner.  That shell script (per CWL specification) will be created as part of the inital working directory.  The `shrek.cwl` workflow is responsible for exposing the parameters specified in the yaml file as environment variables, and copying the user's command blocks into the script at appropriate points.  

`shrek.cwl` (in the standalone test-rig above) implements a command line tool wrapper around the *generated* script.

For the production system, `shrek.cwl` is a workflow that `submits the generated script` via prun.

Herein lies the problem.  Which pchain is invoked, it starts by building a tarball of the current working directory tree (minus files over a large size limit).  That tarball is sent to the PanDA server, where the workflow is executed.  Based on some tests I am fairly confident that the tarball is not unpacked / repacked on the PanDA server.  So the files which are generated by CWL (that I need) are not sent to the worker node for processing.  

Emailing Tadashi to confirm, and ask if this is a feature that would be reasonable to add.
