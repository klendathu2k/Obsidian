Likely to need an in-memory representation of the graph of job descriptions we are building.  It would also be nice to have some level of error checking during the build process, so we can quickly identify and debug errors in the workflow.  So ideally we would want to have a python based graph library.

[python-graph](https://github.com/Shoobx/python-graph)
- Stable, reasonably active, have to build code using make? documentation lacking?  (built with make?)

[networkx](https://networkx.org/)
- Stable, reasonably active, extensive documentation in easy reach...

[graph-tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/)
- ... 

Basically narrows down to the last two... will do a quick evaluation.
