sPHENIX Production / SHREK
- Interacted w/ Tadashi by email... job submission issue seemed to be due to lack of output DS being defined...  
	- sometimes you just need to see the log file...
	- this revealed a panda/pchain/idds bug (not really sure where the bug was...) that resulted in the job being silently killed (no error reported, but no jobs / error messages show up in the monioring...)  
	- as usual... I seem to find the unexpected/untested corner cases
- Plan for the day is to keep pushing to setup pass 2.  Need to review notes from last week to
