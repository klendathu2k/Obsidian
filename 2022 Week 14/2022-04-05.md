	- Tadashi does not seem interested in adding the CWL InitialWorkDir entries into the tarball sent to the condor.... 
		- Naively I am assuming that PanDA is executing the CWL file with a CWL-runner on the remote server. 
		-  If so, then the shell scripts created by the CWL InitialWorkDir requirement would be available and could be added to the tarball without much effort on his part.
		-  Could there be security concerns?  (Same concerns/solutuions for uploading the user code tarball I would imagine)
		-  OTOH, if PanDA is handling the workflow itself (i.e. if PanDA is a CWL runner) then it may be more effort to implement this than he has time for.
	- Either way... pays off to think about other options for achieving the same goal...
		- When in doubt... templates
		- Natural solution here.  The workflows themselves will be fixed, so we only need to update wtih changes to parameters (such as input data sets, user scripts to run, etc...)
		- In the language specification... $ is reserved for expressions, # for comments.  % is reserved by the PanDA.  [array] is the array syntax.  So... let's reserve @VAR as a template substitution.  Any token beginning with @XYZ will be replaced with XYZ as defined in some input file....  
	- Actually,... I must think of another solution.  PanDA cannot support this feature (tarball is pushed before cwl-runner can provide the initial work directory...)
		- Need to think through what needs to be templated...
			- @PRODUCTION_TAG
			- @SOFTWARE_TAG
			- @INPUT_DATASET
			- @OUTPUT_FILENAME
			- @OUTPUT_TARGET_DIRECTORY
			- ...
		- Another possibilitiy is to .... no.  Just no.  Wait for it... but... no... yes?  no.  No no no no...
			- Si.
			- Run cwl-runner on the remote machine to wrap the job.  Done.
			- Okay... cwl-runner is not avail on sphnxpro.  But this can be massaged.
