What Victor is doing (I think):
- star-bnl:star-sw/main --> branched --> star-bnl:star-sw/Star6
- star-bnl:star-sw --> forked --> victor:star-sw
	- (infrequently) PR's from victor:star-sw/Star6 to star-bnl:main/Star6
		- large divergence between *his* fork/branch and *star-bnl* main

What Victor *should* be doing
- star-bnl:star-sw --> forked --> victor:star-sw
- victor:star-sw/main --> branch victor:star-sw/star-root6-devel
- *frequently* (once per single problem solved)
	- commit changes to victor:star-sw/star-root6-devel
	- pull changes from star-bnl:star-sw/main *and merge* with your branch
	- push your branch to github
	- victor:star-sw/star-root6-devel --> pull request star-bnl:main
