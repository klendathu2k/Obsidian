STAR Forward

Fairly certain that material budget issue is due to air being counted in the volume... (it's a surprisingly large contribution...)  So mdify the agml checker to allow one to ignore air...

Added code to ignore Air contribution in material plots... made PR... Nicole does not confirm it works.

- There is a second section of code where the filter needs to be applied
- There appears to be a mismatch ... I think that we are filling the material histograms wrong.... one step off.  Or rather one node off.  (Material should come from the end node, not the start node,  of the step?)

sPHENIX workflows

[20 jobs @ 200 events](https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?jeditaskid=133204|133201) running over a 4h timescale.  Ramp this up to 200 jobs and submit full chain.

Some more on the geometry memory layout idea... 

Combining flexclass with type-erased containers... probably won't work.  Why?  Because FC requires the memory allocated to the arrays to be known at the point of contstruction.  But TE allows one to store *any* type within an array.  Thus, memory requirement cannot be computed at the point of construction.

This means that *shapes* cannot be stored w/in a flexclass array.... because, again, the number of parameters (and thus the size) of the shape cannot by determined apriori...
