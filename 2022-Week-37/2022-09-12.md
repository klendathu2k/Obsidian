------------------------

STAR Collaboration meeting this week.  

Monday -- Junior's Day

Probably not worth sitting in on many talks, but will zoom connect into Rongrong's and Daniel's presentations @ 1030 AM.   Theory talk from a (new-ish) NMSU prof... too bad it's not Mattias. 



Tuesday -- Parallel Sessions

Some interesting looking cold QCD talks... 

Wednesday -- Parallel Sessions

Hard probes WG... Talk on a pythia model... May be worth catching.

Thursday -- Plenary Sessions...

Should attend the morning sessions.  (WIll need to take the afternoon sessions from home by remote b/c Brianna has gym... but need to double check this...)

Friday -- Plenary Sessions

Again, morning sessions should be interesting / relevant.
