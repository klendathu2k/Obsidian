500 signal jobs + 2k BG jobs (reusable) 
https://panda-doma.cern.ch/tasks/?jeditaskid=132498|132497|132499|132518|132496

Ran to completion.  Output files for each of the reconstruction jobs look to be reasonable in size.  Can we scale further?

Try doubling up on the input list... (does PanDA check for duplication here?)
