sPHENIX workflow is running at the scale of 10 HF events @ 10 jobs.  Plan is to scale (eventually) to 1k events / job.  

To reduce the number of minbias events we need to run... should allow the reuse of files in the secondary stream... 

```  
--reusableSecondary REUSABLESECONDARY
A comma-separated list of secondary streams which reuse files when all files are used
```

Should consider refactoring...

`--workDir WORKDIR     All files under WORKDIR will be transfered to WNs (default=./)`

... maybe pchain sends files to remote server, and from remote server, back?
