Reported two issues:
1) Jobs still being terminated due to wall time... 
2) Jobs fell into a held state (not clear that they were held, btw)... due to a rucio hiccup.
	- Once the rucio issue was resolved, the jobs restarted.
	- Rucio hiccup was solved by Matt Snyder...  "restarted the postgresql service to get you back in business short-term. But real solution looks like we need to tune psql connection pooling."
3) Will need to really stress test the system to points of failure...

Tested
`$ rucio close <blah>`

Works.  It changes the is_open flag from the True to False state.

Tested
`$ rucio set-metadata --did <blah> --key run_number --value 12345`

Works.  Sets the run_number field to 12345.

So... thinking that there should be some manipulation of metadata done at the end of the run... once a task is finished, we go to a finishBlah.yaml.  Create a summary dataset which does some analysis, gets some statistics, etc...  Then a merge at the end will close the dataset and set meta flags.
